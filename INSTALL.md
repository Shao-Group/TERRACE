# Install TERRACE from Source

TERRACE uses additional libraries of Boost and htslib. 
If they have not been installed in your system, you first
need to download and install them. You might also need to
export the runtime library path to certain environmental
variable (for example, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, for most linux distributions).
After install these dependencies, you then compile the source code of TERRACE.
If some of the above dependencies are not installed to the default system 
directories (for example, `/usr/local`, for most linux distributions),
their corresponding installing paths should be specified to `configure` of TERRACE.
The entire installation typically takes a few minutes to complete.

## Download Boost
If Boost has not been downloaded/installed, download Boost
[(license)](http://www.boost.org/LICENSE_1_0.txt) from (http://www.boost.org).
Uncompress it somewhere (compiling and installing are not necessary).

## Install htslib
If htslib has not been installed, download htslib 
[(license)](https://github.com/samtools/htslib/blob/develop/LICENSE)
from (http://www.htslib.org/) with version 1.5 or higher.
Note that htslib relies on zlib. So if zlib has not been installed in your system,
you need to install zlib first. To do so, download zlib
[(license)](https://zlib.net/zlib_license.html) at (https://zlib.net/).
Use the following commands to install zlib:
```
./configure
make
make install
```
After installing zlib, use the following commands to build htslib:
```
./configure --disable-bz2 --disable-lzma --disable-gcs --disable-s3 --enable-libcurl=no
make
make install
```
The default installation location of htslib is `/usr/lib`.
If you would install it to a different location, replace the above `configure` line with
the following (by adding `--prefix=/path/to/your/htslib` to the end):
```
./configure --disable-bz2 --disable-lzma --disable-gcs --disable-s3 --enable-libcurl=no --prefix=/path/to/your/htslib
```
In this case, you also need to export the runtime library path (note that there
is an additional `lib` following the installation path):
```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/your/htslib/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

## Build TERRACE

Use the following to compile TERRACE:
```
aclocal
autoconf
autoheader
automake -a
./configure --with-htslib=/path/to/your/htslib --with-boost=/path/to/your/boost
make
```

If some of the dependencies are installed in the default system directory (for example, `/usr/lib`),
then the corresponding `--with-` option might not be necessary.
The executable file `terrace` will appear at `src/terrace`.
